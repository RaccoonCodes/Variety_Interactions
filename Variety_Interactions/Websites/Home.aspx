            My name is <b>Ricardo Martinez</b> and this is a multipage application that shows
        various interaction that I was able to make in my spare time. This is in ASP.Net with C#
        and few javascript coding. There is also Bootstrap 5 and CSS style included.
        <br />
            <br />
            A little about me. . .
        <br />
            <br />
            I have 8 year expereince in coding. My most used languages are C++ and C#.
        I have also done a few project such as Android app development and some cryptography. 
        My stongest expertise right now are C++ programming and Web Development. Althought I believe I have 
        two projects uploaded in my github right now that revolve web development, I hope this proves some lead way of 
        what I am capable of. 
        <br />
            <br />
            Also I love learning new things that revolve technology. I graduated from 
        Harper College with an Associate Degree in Computer Science and Elmhurst University
        with Bachelor's in Computer Science and Cyber Security. I also have 4 years of graphic design.
            <br />
            <br />
            Anyways, please have a look at the my front end and back end coding. I hope I was 
            able to catch most of the bugs.
