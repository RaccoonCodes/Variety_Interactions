Money Exchange:
The currency rate last update is posted on the top of the content page

World Clock and Countdown:
The page gets the current time based on when the page is loaded. Meaning it is not dynamic.
On the Countdown, I only added a few holiday that takes account if the holiday has already passed based on current date.
